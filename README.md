Welcome to my Java Programs Repository! This repository contains a collection of Java projects, assignments, and practice programs that I have developed as part of my learning journey in Java programming. 
This repository includes a variety of Java programs, ranging from basic syntax demonstrations to advanced applications involving object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, database connectivity, and GUI development using Java Swing.
KEY FEATURES:
✅ Beginner to Advanced Programs – Covers fundamental concepts, algorithms, and real-world applications.
✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Implementation of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
✅ Database Connectivity (JDBC) – Java programs integrated with databases using MySQL and SQLite.
✅ Java Swing GUI Applications – Interactive desktop applications using Swing and AWT.
✅ Multi-Threading & Concurrency – Programs demonstrating thread handling and parallel processing.
✅ File Handling & I/O Operations – Reading, writing, and manipulating files in Java.
